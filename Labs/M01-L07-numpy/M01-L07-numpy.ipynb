In the exercise, you will both practice the Numpy features we discussed in the lesson and learn new features by looking up documentations and references.\n","\n","## Getting Started\n","There are a bunch of comments which instruct what you are supposed to do step by step. Follow the order of the instructions from top to bottom. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it. You should also test your answers to make sure your responses are correct. If one of your responses is incorrect, you may not be able to proceed because later responses may depend upon previous responses.\n","\n","\n","## Resources\n","\n","Some of the questions in the assignment are not covered in our lesson.
